Late 2015 I attended a [hackathon][bathhack] which pushed me to explore create more. I have been studying for a computer science degree, but other than creating a couple of apps for the Google Play Store, I've never really created much outside of study. I think that this website can be a good central place for me to organise and keep track of online life, while also sharing it with others who may find it useful.

I am planning on having my social media links, a CV, and various blogs about things I am learning. I am planning on writing about my experience of Jekyll (this), AWS and minecraft servers, domains and how to use them, handwriting, and Triathlon. I have many other things to write about and I will see how this goes.
