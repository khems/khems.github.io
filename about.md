I am a second year computer science student at the University of Bath. I enjoy triathlon, computing, meeting people and learning new skills. Feel free to follow me on social media below. 

This site is a place for me to share things I've learned, and [mc.khems.net][http://mc.khems.net] is a place for you to play Minecraft with me and my friends.
